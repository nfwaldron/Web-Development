            <p style="color: #aaaaaa;">Nathan Waldron aka Fally is an aspiring intellectual, tryina find his way in life. 
			   He's laid back, inquisitive, and extremely friendly (with no once-you-get-to-know-him post-requisite). 
			   Right now, he's experiencing tremendous growth pains, as he attempts to both lay ahold of manhood, 
			   and comprehend various web technologies. 
			   Always working hard, our young hero presses forward towards the mark of success, his righteous heart 
			   fed by the fiery flames of a deep conviction; the origin of which has not yet been deciphered.
